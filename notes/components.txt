What are components
Component in angular
how to make and use component
files of component

components -> parts of the system, we can use one component into another component

app.css
app.html
app.spec.ts
app.ts

ng generate component login - it will create the component inside the app folder
ng g c signup

it will create login component when i call this use the selector name of the component in the app.html 
and also import the login component inside app.ts file as well

<app-login></app-login>



custom component

in creating a component first letter should be smaller


import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
    selector : 'app-profile',
    template : '<h1>Prasanth Deventhiran</h1>',
    style: 'h1{color:'red'}'
})

export class ProfileComponent{

}

if you are using html element as selector yes it working but its not good to use
