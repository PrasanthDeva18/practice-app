creation 
constructor is a method, it is running when component created 

change detection
ngOnInit() -> it will runs once after the component initialized

rendering

afterNextRender->

afterRender -> 


destruction 
ngOnDestroy - the component remove from ui it will runs 



🔶 1. CREATION PHASE

This phase occurs when Angular first creates the component instance.

a) constructor()

The constructor is the first method to run.

It is used mainly for dependency injection, such as injecting services.

The component is not yet fully initialized, and DOM elements are not available.

Heavy tasks like API calls should not be performed here.

b) ngOnChanges()

This hook runs whenever the input properties (@Input) of a component change.

It is called before ngOnInit.

It helps in responding to changes coming from the parent component.

c) ngOnInit()

Runs only once after the component is initialized.

This is the ideal place for:

API calls

Initial data loading

Setting default values

It guarantees that Angular has set up all inputs before execution.

🔶 2. CHANGE DETECTION PHASE

Angular continuously checks for changes in data and updates the UI accordingly.

ngDoCheck()

A custom change detection hook.

Runs frequently whenever Angular detects any change.

Used when ngOnChanges is not enough to detect deeper changes.

🔶 3. RENDERING PHASE

Angular renders the component’s template and updates the DOM.

In Angular 16+, two new rendering lifecycle methods were introduced:

a) afterNextRender()

Runs only once after the component is rendered for the first time.

Similar to ngAfterViewInit().

Useful for reading DOM values or performing tasks after the first UI display.

b) afterRender()

Runs after every render cycle.

Useful when you want code to execute whenever the DOM updates.

Angular's classic rendering hooks are still important:

c) ngAfterContentInit()

Runs once after Angular projects external content using <ng-content>.

d) ngAfterContentChecked()

Runs after every check of projected content.

e) ngAfterViewInit()

Called once when the component’s view and child views are fully initialized.

Safe place to access child components or DOM elements using ViewChild.

f) ngAfterViewChecked()

Runs after every view check.

Useful for debugging render cycles.

🔶 4. DESTRUCTION PHASE
ngOnDestroy()

Runs when the component is removed from the DOM or user navigates away.

Used to perform cleanup tasks like:

Unsubscribing from Observables

Clearing intervals and timeouts

Removing event listeners

Prevents memory leaks and ensures application performance.
